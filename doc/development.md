# Developing the website of Pluggable Transports software

Two important links first:

1. Development repository: <https://github.com/Pluggable-Transports/Pluggable-Transports-software/>
2. Deployment URL: <https://software.pluggabletransports.info/>

In this section some hints for developing this index from the server site are
given.

- The whole index is a **static website** generated by
  [bundler](https://bundler.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
  and hosted on
  [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

- There is **no limitation** to host the generated static pages on any other
  **arbitrary webserver**.

- Build the static websites with bundler/Jekyll:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Pluggable-Transports/Pluggable-Transports-software
  cd packages
  bundle install
  bundle exec jekyll build
  ```
  and copy the content of the generated `_site` directory to the webserver of
  your choice.

- Basically, there are two layouts.
  One for the package index `_layouts/package_index.html` (used by
  `assets/index.md`) and one for the individual packages pages
  `_layouts/package.html` (used by all `.md` files in the `package` directory).

- The index read by `package_index_resolve()` is generated from
  `packages/index.md`.

- The package index page uses following JavaScript/CSS frameworks:
  - [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for awesome fonts.
  - [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): for simply good-looking design.
  - [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) for a dynamic search feature.
    Configuration at <https://datatables.net/download/index>:
    ```
    Styling framework
      [x] DataTables
    Packages
      [x] DataTables
    Extensions
      [x] Scroller
    Download method: CDN
      [x] Minify
      [x] Concatenate
    ```
    If no JavaScript is available, a static HTML table is displayed.
  - [jQuery](https://jquery.com/): needed by bootstrap and DataTables.

- The individual package pages are generated by filling the layout with the
  metadata given in YAML format,
  as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
