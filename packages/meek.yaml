  meek is a blocking-resistant pluggable transport for Tor. It encodes a data
  stream as a sequence of HTTPS requests and responses. Requests are reflected
  through a hard-to-block third-party web server in order to avoid talking
  directly to a Tor bridge. HTTPS encryption hides fingerprintable byte patterns
  in Tor traffic.
