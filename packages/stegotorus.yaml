  Stegoturs is a Free (as in freedom) pluggable transport (PT) development
  framework, streamlining the job of developing smarter and stealthier pluggable
  transports than the conventional ones currently in use.  Stegotorus framework
  provides an API specifically geared towards the needs of steganographic
  protocols. Using these API, developers can write PTs which can effectively
  hide from deep packet inspection systems (DPI), but also resist
  nondiscriminatory adversarial behaviours such as throttling or packet and
  connection dropping.

  Stegotorus disentangles the part of the PT code which manages the network
  communications from the part responsible for encoding the information. In the
  Stegotorus jargon, the former is known as protocol and the latter - as steg
  modules. A system can have several protocols and steg modules working
  together. In this way, different censorship countermeasures can be developed
  to bypass censorship in modular forms. As well, one or many modules can be
  used in different situations.
