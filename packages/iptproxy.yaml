  Obfs4proxy and Snowflake Pluggable Transports for iOS and Android. Both
  Obfs4proxy and Snowflake Pluggable Transports are written in Go, which is a
  little annoying to use on iOS and Android. This project encapsulates all the
  machinations to make it work and provides an easy to install binary including a
  wrapper around both.
